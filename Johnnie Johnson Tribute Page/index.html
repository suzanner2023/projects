       <ul>
        <li><span class="date">
        July 8,1924</span> Johnnie Johnson was born in Fairmont, West Virginia.
        <li><span class="date">1928</span> Johnnie teaches himself to play piano. 
<li><span class="date">1941</span> President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs an executive order allowing African-Americans be recruited by the Marine Corps with the caveat that they would attend separate boot camps.
 <li><span class="date"> Early 1940s</span> Johnnie enlists in the Marines, and was sent Montford Point. His unit was comprised of the first African American Marines, who endured racism while serving their country and inspired social change while integrating the previously all-white Marine Corps during World War II. At Montford he also became a member of Bobby Troup's all-serviceman jazz orchestra, the Barracudas.
  <li><span class="date">Mid 1940s</span> Out of the Marines, Johnny spends time in Detroit and Chicago
  <li><span class="date">1952</span> Johnnie moves to St. Louis and forms a jazz and blues group, the Sir John Trio with saxaphonist Alvin Bennett and drummer Ebby (or Eddie) Hardy.
  <li><span class="date">New Year's Eve 1952</span>, Bennett has a stroke and can't perform, Johnnie brings in Chuck Berry as a last minute replacement. Johnson knew Berry wasn't in a band and was likely available at short notice. Berry was still developing his skills as a guitarist but was a natural showman, and with Bennett unable to continue with the band, Johnson added Berry as a permanent member of the trio. 
<li><span class="date">1955</span> Chuck Berry travels to Chicago to see his favorite musician, Muddy Waters. Berry asks Waters how he can get on a record label, and Waters tells him to go talk to Leonard Chess at Chess Records. The next day Berry goes to Chess Records and impresses Leonard Chess enough that Chess asks him to bring a recording of his band. The next week Berry returns to Chicago with a recording of his band doing their song "Ida Mae" to Chicago, Chess likes it and agrees to record the band. 
        <li><span class="date">Mid 1955</span> Berry, Johnson and Hardy go to Chicago to record four songs. One of those songs is <span class="single">"Ida Mae"</span>. Because <span class="single">"Ida Mae"</span> was based on a Western swing song <span class="single">"Ida Red"</span>, Chess wants to change the name to something else, and <span class="single">"Ida Mae"</span> becomes <span class="single">"Maybellene"</span>. Chess decides to add bass player Willie Dixon and percussionist Jerome Green on maracas to the <span class="single">"Maybellene"</span> session.
        <li><span class="date">August 1955</span> <span class="single">"Maybellene"</span> is number #1 on the R&B charts and hits #5 on the Pop Top 100 charts 2 weeks later. At WINS in New York, disc jockey Alan Freed played the song for two hours straight one night. Chuck Berry was signed to Chess as a solo artist and Johnson and Hardy agreed to be his band. 
    <li><span class="date">1955 - 1973</span> Johnson continues to play with Chuck Berry, recording songs such as <span class="single">Roll Over Beethoven"</span> and <span class="single">"You Can Never Tell"</span> with Johnson on piano. 
        <li><span class="date">1970s-1990s</span> Johnson lived in St. Louis, played in bands and supported himself by driving a bus. 
        <li><span class="date">1977</span> Johnson releases the album <span class="album">Blue Hand Johnnie</span> for St. Louis-based label Pulsar. 
    <li><span class="date">1986</span> Johnson is featured in the Chuck Berry concert movie, <span class="movie">Hail! Hail! Rock ‘n’ Roll</span>, playing with Berry, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and others, leading to a revitalization of his musical career.
